            Hi! My name is Alex Contell and this is my little intro page.<br>
            <br>
            I was born in Valencia, Spain, more than three decades ago. I moved to New York in 2013 to pursue a career in photography and filmmaking.<br>
            <br>
            With more time than expected in my hands due to the pandemic, I started learning some coding on the side, which led me here! :)<br>
            <br>
            <br>

        <p>Here are some fun facts about myself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I love eating and traveling (what a surprise)</li>
            <li>Before moving to NY I used to play drums in a band. We were pretty bad.</li>
            <li>My favorite TV show is Seinfeld. Once I found a Seinfeld book on the street and got a picture with it.</li>
            <li>Spanish people have several names and two last names. My first name is Francisco. It gets confusing all the time. Hover over the webs title page for a little word game.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Check out some of my code</h2>


      <p>
          During the summer I started playing around with HTML/CSS and JS and I started creating <a href="https://acm-sp85.github.io/portfolio2020/index.html" target="_blank">my online portfolio.</a><br>
          I still haven't uploaded all of my photographs. Selecting what photographs to show instead of others is a difficult process, and one I struggle with.<br>
          If you want to see more of my photography work you can visit <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alex_contell/" target="_blank">my IG</a>  page or my current website <a href="https://www.alexcontell.com/" target="_blank">www.alexcontell.com</a> <br>
